<p>look,the nets are outdated,kyrie irving has a couple more years left in him.
    
    is 31 and 220 pounds.and he's a shooting guard.Kevin durant is 33 years old</p>
    <p>the suns are a young and upcoming team,devin booker and chris paul are the best guard duo in the
league.deandre ayton is a upcoming superstar center,they have plenty of young role players that could become stars,like mikal brigeis or cam johnson.
 their starting lineup and bench are balenced.</p>
<p>those are my reasons for the suns being better than the nets.like and comment,it will really help me!</p>
