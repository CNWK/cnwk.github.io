<table>
<tr>
    <td>the ps5 is one of the consoles who can brag about having legendary graphics.the playstation geniration is the greatest in video games,
        i like listening to spotify, and the ps5 gives me so much options.the games are amazing,even when my disc is dirty,it still works.the ps5
        is a great console.</td>
    <td>the xbox is a great console because i love how you can get to your game so quickly.like on the ps5 or nintendo switch and you want to get
        to a game that you have not played in a while,you have to go all the way back to the end of the page.on the xbox its right below the last
        game you played.but my complaint about this is the controls are confusing.i press b and it selects.i press a and it goes back.</td>
        <td>the nintendo switch is the least popular,i always try to go to nba2k21,and it takes me out of the game or it turns off.i like to watch youtube,
            and it won't let me in.the nintendo switch lite is just the nintendo but you can't take off the joy-cons.the console is decent at best,</td>
        <td>so who wins?the ps5,it has the better graphics,controls,and upgrades.i love it so much because of the grafics and gameplay.</td>
