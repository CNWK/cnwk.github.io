<h1>creating your own magical creatures</h1>
<h2>can it be easer then it seams?</h2>
<p>Lets say you want to creater a magical creature for the first time well I have come up with some tips for beginers.
so lets start with your creaters morality witch will often afect the rest of its dusine in ways like will the eages be
more ruf or rounded. I dont like to dufine anything by good or eavle so im going to change it into good and mislead and
everything in butwen. So lets say your creater is a hero to the everyone you mite have the eages be more sharp and the
colers be bright and bold and if your using a refrince animal it should not be ginroly tiny or not a sea creacher because
sea creachers can be perseaved as munipylitive or scary and tiny creachers are often consiterd cute and unforchnitly whan 
you look at something that you find cute you often find it less thretning this is supost to be a creacher that is strong 
but genroly cind harted. And there are simaler things for anything else you want your creacher to be mislead becouse it 
feals like it is a god and can cuse who gits to live and dye have toned doun colers and sharp eges there ar all sorts of 
ways to dusine yor chariter soly basted on the persinality.
</p>
<p>The next thing you should think about is the inspiring animal. If this is your first time creating a creacher that dose
    not exsest it is a good idea for you to take insparashen from another exsisting animal but its not like you copy the 
    animal and give it cool magick lets say you git insparashen frome al lian you mite hav the adolt males of your new
    speases have manes and the creachers to char some cat cariteristicks or a butterflye your animal mite hav a medumorafasis
    adn they may lay eggs near what they eat its alwes a ok idea to merg two animals and if your fealing stuck you chould
    take insparashen form another magicol creacher.
</p>
<p>after that you can start thinking about the magick. this is also something to do with the moroles of the creachr but you 
    cant just do light and dark you could find a difrent way to shoe this like fire and ice but that is also a little bit 
    basick and it would be best if you come up with something more creative. When you git to branes and brones if you would 
    say this cariter is more brones then there magick should be a fisicole part of there bode like being able to reginarat lims
    and if there mor branes then they should have something to do with magick with out there fisicole body like being able to sumen 
    mountens with there mind.
</p>
<p>finaly it comes to drawing the creacher. Even if you dont plan to do something with the cariter that would requier you to draw them
    its best to draw them anyway because you will have a easer time invishaning a story with this cariter in it when you can just look
    at it right in front of you. If you have preveis expereins in drawing a similer creacher then you dont nead to do andy of this and you
     chan git strat to drawing but if you dont you should try some of this out unles you are super confudent in your drawing ability I'm going
     trust your jugment. So if your still reading then you whant some edvice on drawing the cariter. firts thigs first you should probuly try 
     trasing something someone else drew that hase some of the same elaments this may soud not ok or like plagerising but as long as you dont
     clame the art as your owne and ask the artist befor you post it anywhere it will be fine and it comes as good practis. after giting the 
     feachers doun in that artis sile you can try to agust to exsactly what you ned them to loock like convert them to oyur owne stile and sloly
      you can pease the creacher togither. if you feal uncomsterbol with this or gut rely dont think you will be able to draw it you can alwes ask
      artistick frend or famly member.
