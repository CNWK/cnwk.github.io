            <p>This website has everything to do with her lore, story, orgins, and generally anything else to do with her. 
                This website will be a repository of all lore, art, and fanfics of her. 
                There will be a list of her followers as well, and a page to honor her creator,

                Fanpage for Crown of Madness, a group of chaos spreaders on Flight Rising.</p>
            <p> The creator of this website is <a style="color: rgb(214, 244, 255);" 
                href="https://flightrising.com/main.php?p=lair&tab=userpage&id=523975">TsunamiVoid</a>. 
                Contact her if you have any problems with the website.</p>
            <p>A few things you should know about the creator. She likes the color blue, loves dragons, sleeping, and reading. 
                She is not always available. If you don't get a response within several hours, do not worry. She may be sleeping,
                as she is 3 hours ahead of Flight Rising time. The creator also loves writing lore. She is currently working on
                lore for her lair and dragons, partially based on the Lorebreaker.</p>
