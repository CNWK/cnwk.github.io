        <h1>Wish</h1>
        <p> Wish is the Lorebreaker, and not much is known about her. She had her origins in a time before Flight Rising.
            She is the one who caused the Impocalypse. As more is learned about her, more will be added.
        </p>
        <p>All hail Wish, the Lorebreaker!</p>
