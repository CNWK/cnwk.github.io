         <p style="color: black">Hi! Welcome to kids news. This is news for kids so they can undaerstand what the real news is saying. Right now we are in panic, or in this case, pendamic. The reason the pendemic is happening is because people touch there faces and body's and do not wash there hands before they touchthemself too! Don't forget to wash your hands before you touch face and after. Many people has died because they did not wash there hands when they needed to. Now, don't start thinking that kids are safe from the Covid-19. I have heard there are cases that kids are starting to have cases of Covid. I know this is a hard time but this is just the bad news. The good news is that people are felling better. But this picture below shows the black death. There are other vireses that are worse than this one. The thing is, after ten or even more years, kids think school is BORING! BUT NOW, kids want to go to school and and see there friends and teashers. I know you might here this in a your phone or your parents phone but, those buzzers stand for kids being stolen. They don't just buzz as soon as a kid has been stolen. Ether a parent or a sobling or anyone buzzes it. I am trying to figure out why they are doing this because what do they need from children. If you know then you should tell me. I think you guys know that camps and classes are starting to open, but if you still don't feel safe on going outide after 3 to 4 mothes of qurantine, then don't go. Do whatever feels sfe for you. If you can only do the in person class then either put your classes on hold or quit. If you can not go on pause then quit. Either it's the company's problem or the teacher's problem. Classes are classes. Now camps is a diffrent story. Camps are optional. If you want to go you can go at your own risk. If your parets don't want you to go, don't go! On 6/12/20, there was a big esplosion in the down town. The firefighters, the police, the FBI, and the ATF are trying to figure out who set out the fire or what set the fire.
