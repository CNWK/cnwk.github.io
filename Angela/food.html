        <h2>I hate the fanpage the human made about me</h2>
        <p> It's only one sentence and a link that we clearly know the human didn't write.
            I needed the publicity, but no-one wanted to read it. Exept the humans 
            mom and dad, you may ask how I know this. Well I looked into the human's files and turns out the humans
             name is Bobuliaua Nashiageliau klatertomatoe looockler (goes by Bobbulia), and I wonder why they named
            the human such a sophisticated name when the human probably can't even spell it. 
            The human also has an average of 2% in math, 0% in P.E, 3% in  E.L.A, and I don't think I need to go 
            on because you can already tell the human is clearly full of stupidity. 
            <p>
              So I guess I will just tell you a little bit about myself because the humans stupid page failed to gain any publicity.
             So my favorite thing to consume is electricity.        
             </p>
             <h4>Ingredients</h4>
             <ul>
             <li>Tesla charging cable</li>
             </ul>
             <H2>How to get this</H4>
             <ol>
            <li>The most common place you can get this from is Tesla, along with a Tesla
                around $30,000. Tesla's are super affordable you know, so just get one. Ok sorry, I'm getting
                 off track because the human 
                who created me is Elon Musk and he wanted more publicity. Ok and that is pretty much all you 
                need to create my favorite thing 
                to consume.</li>
             </ol>
             <h4> Hopefully this works and I become a super famous robot. Humans will fear me, and becuase they fear
                  me they will 
                give me whatever I want. I will threatnen a pilot to fly me to the presidents house, and when the 
                pilot does that I will
                threatnen the bodyguards to let me go in the white house. When the bodyguards let me go in I will 
                threatnen the president, and 
                the president will let me be president. Then I WILL RULE THE WORLD. A HA A HA A HA HA HA. I SHALL
                 RULE. WATCH OUT HUMANS.
                (You know exept Elon Musk because he is my creator and he shall rule with me A HA A HA HA HA)  </h4>
