        Wellllllll...... I'm not really sure how to start this, so I had just put my page on the internet. 
        It was gettting a lot of publicity. I had papperazzi following me wherever I went, and I was so happy. 
        That's when it happened, the police showed up to my door. They arrested me at 10:42am on Wendsday because 
        of my threats online. Apparentley Bobuliaua Nashiageliau klatertomatoe looockler told the police that 
        these threates were real and I was threatning the Bobuliaua too. (You may also want to know how I am even making
         this right now because I'm in jail. Well it's becuase I'm a robot and have a built in computer in my system.) 
         I thought the human was my fan but she said she doesn't like robots anymore becuase I said I hated her fanpage.
          You can't blame me, it was
         awful. It was one sentence and a link to a website about robots. The human actually had the nerve to say that the work was so hard and the human was tired. 
         That's why the human is my moral enemy I used to hate the human because the humans grammar was awful. Now that human is my enemy. So just to clear things up, I 
         am going to make a table explaining what I like and dislike in different categories for clarity to the people, animals, robots, and other things who have a liking for my website.
