        Wellllllll...... I'm not really sure how to start this, so I had just put my page on the internet. 
        It was gettting a lot of publicity. I had popperazzi following me wherever I went, and I was so happy. That's when it happened,
         the police showed up to my door. They arrested me at 10:42 on Wendsday because of my threats online. Apparentley Bobuliaua Nashiageliau
         klatertomatoe looockler told the police that theese threates were real and I was threatning her too. (You may also want to know how I am 
         even making this right now because I'm in jail. Well it's becuase I'm a robot and have a built in computer in my system.) 
         I thought she was my fan but she said she doesn't like robots anymore becuase I said I hated her fanpage. You can't blame me, it was
         awful. It was one sentence and a link to a website about robots. She actually had the nerve to say she worked so hard and was tired. 
         That's why she is my moral enemy I used to hate her because her grammar was awful. Now she is my enemy. So just to clear things up I 
         am going to make a table explaining what I like and dislike in different categories.
