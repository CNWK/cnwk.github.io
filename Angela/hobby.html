        <h1>I am sincerley sorry</h1>
        <p>
            I need to get out of prision. My sentence has gotten longer because I made another page and put it on the internet. I'm so sorry. 
            That is why I'm making this page, to apoligize. I know most of you might be thinking "Robots can't feel emotion." Well your right, 
            but I just installed a program where I can feel emotion. So hopefully you know how sorry I am. I was totally lying when I said 
            I disliked police, I love people because uh........they are cool um........... yeah. So I uh love ya police people. 
        </p>
        <h2>How I'm doing </h2>
        <p>
            After being in jail for about 1 week.... I've gone completeley INSANE I hate it here. It's even worse because I have emotion now, 
            I keep getting mad and shooting lasers at police people and the prision people (by the way I'm sorry for that.) Also because 
            I keep shooting lasers at people I keep getting in more and more trouble and their even threatning to take away my computer. Don't 
            worry because I don't think I'll get in trouble for making this page because It's an apology. I also want to escape so badly, but 
            Elon Musk (my creator) said to hold on because he said he's gonna get me out of here. I hope he does because I can't
            keep living with these hooligans.

        <h3>What happens in jail</h3>
        <p>
            In jail you can't really do much, but when I'm bored I like to......
            <ul>
            <li>consume elctricty to charge me up for the day</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>play oputside</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li>play outside</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li>read pages about Elon Musk <a href="https://www.tesla.com/elon-musk">like this one</a> </li> 
            <ul>
                <li>read funny memes off my computer like this one</li> 
            </ul>
         <p>
             <img width=200 src=
             One time my prision inmate touched my metal when I was charging and he died (I never really 
            liked him he would always steal my sheld allures.) Jail isn't all that bad though. I get to consume as much electricity as I want,
            where as with Elon, he didn't really let me have as much as I wanted.
