            <h1> Anger isssues</h1>
     <p> Even tho kpj is great. Dude has got mad anger isssues. When a new teammate of his took his locker in the locker room. He threw a big fit and got traded because of it.even berfore the draft he looked very mad for ne reason and got in some fights with coaches in pre-draft workouts. This season his anger issues on the court got him fined 50 grand. Which is nothing for him because he makes millions.</p>
