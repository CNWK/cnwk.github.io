                eating, and living. I also like cupcakes, pizza, ramen, dragonfruit, 
                and oranges. My other likes include waffles, ice-cream, macarons, 
                and water. I also like playing Video Games. My favorite video game is Ace 
                Attorney. In that game, you are a defense attorney.

                Preston plays Minecraft, Roblox, and likes to sit in his room.
                His dad wants him to work out, but working is not as fun as playing
                video games. His dad also tells him to eat healthier, but he says, "NO!".
                Instead, Preston chips all day. All his chips are his favorite. He does 
                not discrimate between chips. His occupation is a Discord mod, and this
                is a very engaging job. He makes 2 cents a week (paid in in-game currency).
